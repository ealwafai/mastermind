Mastermind Game Rules


OBJECT OF THE GAME

The object of MASTERMIND is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colors. Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code.

Game

You, as the Codebreaker, will attempt to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the secret code.

The colors are: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.
Enter on the keyboard (r) for Red, (g) for Green, (b) for Blue, and (y) for Yellow.

The game will indicate the number of correct colors regardless of position and the correct colors based on the correct positions. The game will calculate the number of guesses as well as the total time it took the Codebreaker to figure out the correct sequence.

You will have unlimited tries, and your input is case insensitive. Good luck!
